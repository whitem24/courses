# Project 1: Creating a DAPP 

For project one create a DAPP that interacts with a smart contract. Some ideas to consider are creating a shared wallet, treasuery or a DAO that only lets members vote on proposals. 

 The project must includes the following:

1. Getters that read from your contact and setters that write to your smart contract.
2. Have at least one transaction. 
3. A front-end for your DAPP using Ethers.js and your favorite front-end framework (Vue, React, etc). 

**Bonus:** Incorporate Solidity events into your smart contract and DAPP. For a quick 101 on Events, see this [resouce](https://blog.chain.link/events-and-logging-in-solidity/) and [this](https://solidity-by-example.org/events/). 

You can also debug your contract using the `console.log()` feature in Hardhat. [Here's](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/debugging-with-hardhat-network.html) a guide to set it up.

You can use Vercel, Github pages, heroku, etc to host your DAPP for free. If you run into an error with Vercel when deploying [here's](https://dev.to/rabihcigar/treating-warnings-as-errors-because-process-env-ci-true-22i4) the fix.
