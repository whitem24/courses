# Project 2: Creating Your Own Meme Coin 

For project two create your own meme token. Give it a clever name, ticker symbol, and an initial amount. You can use the [OpenZepplin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/) contract libraries or if you really want to challenge your self do it all from sratch.

 The project must includes the following:

1. Getters that read from your contact and setters that write to your smart contract.
2. Incorporate the ability to burn, mint, transfer tokens.
3. Render the name, symbol, balance, token owner, and total supply of your token on the front-end.
4. A front-end for your DAPP using Ethers.js and your favorite front-end framework (Vue, React, etc). 

**Bonus:** Incorporate Solidity events into your smart contract and DAPP. For a quick 101 on Events, see this [resouce](https://blog.chain.link/events-and-logging-in-solidity/) and [this](https://solidity-by-example.org/events/).

You can use Vercel, Github pages, heroku, etc to host your DAPP for free. If you run into an error with Vercel when deploying [here's](https://dev.to/rabihcigar/treating-warnings-as-errors-because-process-env-ci-true-22i4) the fix.
